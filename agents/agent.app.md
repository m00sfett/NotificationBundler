# Agent Brief â€” App Shell & Navigation

Goal: Maintain a clean, single-activity Compose app with bottom navigation across six screens (Dashboard, Preview, Schedules, Filters, Log, Settings). Keep strings in German via resources; keep code/comments in English. Avoid business logic here; connect to ViewModels later.

Tasks:
- Flesh out each screen with state & events.
- Add a preview UI to show the next batch.
- Provide a package picker (labels via PackageManager) for filters.
